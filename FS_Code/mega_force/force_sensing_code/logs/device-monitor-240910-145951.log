Initializing
Do you want to recalibrate the scale? 0 for no, 1 for S1, 2 for S2, 3 for S3, 4 for S4, 5 for all
1 pass.
2 pass
3 pass
4 pass.
Place a 50 N weight onto the load cell, press any number then enter.
NOTE: this process will calibrate to Newtons.
Calibrating to 50.00 N...
Tare value: 501219.00
Averaged value with weight, minus tare: 		8770.6601562500
